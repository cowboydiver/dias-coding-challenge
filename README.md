# Dias Coding Challenge by Jan Carus

From what I could gather from the assignment, I chose to implement a few pages with lists displaying a set of mock data relating to the assignment. A static sidebar allows for navigation between the list pages. 

I chose to use Chakra-UI as my component library since this is what I am familiar with, but other libraries could also be considered such as Radix for an unstyled, open-source option.

The project was created using Next.js which provides some initial setup to get started quickly and a quick feedback loop when developing. Furthermore, there are many performance benifits using Next.js such as server side rendering, image optimatization and more. It also provides a nice routing system for loading screens and error pages. It allows deployment to the Vercel platform allowing developers to easily share the web application with others by url.

The web application can be found on the url below.
